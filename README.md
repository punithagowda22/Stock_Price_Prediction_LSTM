The historical stock price data used in this project is sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) or any other financial dataset provider. It includes daily stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close) and volume.
 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scaling, and sequence generation for LSTM input.  
2. **Model Building**: Construct an LSTM network using TensorFlow/Keras.  
3. **Training**: Train the LSTM model on historical stock data.  
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE or MAPE.  
5. **Visualization**: Compare predicted vs actual stock prices through plots.

Results
The model successfully predicts stock price trends, helping to visualize potential future movements in stock prices.
